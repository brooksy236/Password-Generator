# Password-Generator

This is my Password-Generator project.

## **User Story**

The JavaScript generates a random password for the user based on the criteria they select: of a length 8 - 128 characters; should use at least one of uppercase, lowercase, numerical or special characters. The password will then be displayed for the user to see.
